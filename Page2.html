    <h3>About</h3>
    <li>This is the live link to the page https://zhenyu033.github.io/INST377-Final-Project/</li>
    <li>For this project I wanted to explore more about Prince George's County spendings for the year 2023. Using the API located on Prince George's County website (https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/resource/sk5x-gxv7.json).</li>
    <li>I was able to use this API to create a bargraph to demonstrate my findings, and using a filtering system to find specific information users may need. I used canvasjs for my data visualization library for this project.</li>
    <li>The CSS that I used was the one that we were introduced in class and worked on throughout the labs. For this project the goal is to show where Prince George's County is spending their money and what get more fundings compared to other areas of the county.</li>
